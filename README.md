“We need to believe and show in a way our wishes, but also respect them in the same way that we did there. But then at the same time, trying to make Villa Park ours and our fortress. We have experienced that several times, we would like to share a motivated game to play the next day.”
— Unai Emery, the Aston Villa manager
“They’re always a team that will attack a lot. We pressed well, we forced a lot of long balls from them and I think we deserved to win [the first leg]. Even though I thought they were perhaps a bit more defensive than normal, they have the tools to hurt you on the attack."
— Luis Enrique, PSG manager
